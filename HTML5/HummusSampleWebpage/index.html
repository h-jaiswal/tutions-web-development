		<p style="font-size:24px"> This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.
		<br />Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

   		<h2 style="font-size:28px">Ingredients</h2>
		<p style="font-size:22px">I have to use</p>
     		<ul style="font-size:22px">
    			<li>400g of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
			<li>175g of tahini</li>
    			<li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    			<li>Half a red pepper</li>
    			<li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
    			<li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    			<li>A dash of olive oil</li>
     		</ul>

   		<h2  style="font-size:28px">Instructions</h2>
     		<ol style="font-size:22px">
    			<li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely
    			<li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely
    			<li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor
    			<li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.
    			<li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time
    			<li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time
    		</ol>

    		<p style="font-size:28px"> For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

    		<h3 style="font-size:24px">Storage</h3>
		<p style="font-size:22px"> Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>

 		<h4 style="font-size:22px"> Extra Information </h4>
		<p style="font-size:22px"> Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.<p/>
